#-----------------------------------
#  Mapping of cube element positions to mnemonic names
#  Each mnemonic is a three-character pattern, frc, where
#       f indicates the face and is one of F, R, B, L, U, D
#       r indicates the row and is one of T, M, B (for top, middle, bottom, respectively)
#       c indicates the column and is one of L, M, R (for left, middle, right, repectively)
#  The regex for the pattern is r'[FRBLUD][TMB][LMR]'
